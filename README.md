# basic-JavaScript-projects

## About
Thank you to John Smilga for creating this course of beginner Javascript projects and for freeCodeCamp to host it on their YouTube channel where I found it. 

John provided a starter package of prepped code, primarily the CSS and less important HTML, so we could focus on learning JavaScript. Then, in the video, he walked us through every project, explaining the JavaScript and HTML it connected to in a clear manner so I understood what we did, why, and how. The YouTube video walked through the first 15 projects, each one increasing in difficulty and building on what we previously learned.

The course was invaluable for helping me build a solid foundation with JavaScript, so I can better build on it with everything else I need to learn such as frameworks like React and Angular or even Node. Thanks again Mr. Smilga.
